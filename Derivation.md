# Derivation

## Mass: Cube of hydrogen gas at it's triple point

Pressure at triple point  
Density = (0,08988 kg 1/m³ x 273 K x 7,041 kPa) / (101,325 kPa x 13,8033 K) = 0.1235 kg 1/m³

Mass = Volume x Density  
0.211061140542^3 * 0.1235 = 0.001161 kg = 1.161 g

## Force: Pressure on square surface

F = P x A  
F = 7041 Pa x 0.211061140542^2 m² = 313.7 N

## Energy/Work

E = Force x Length  
E = 313.7 N x 0.211061140542 m = 66.21 J

## Time: Accelerated mass

Time it takes for a body of mass M to travel distance L when accelerated with energy E. Or calculated as:

T = ((M x L²) / E)^(1/2)  
T = ((0.001161 g * (0.211061140542 m)^2) / 66.21 J)^(1/2)  
T = 0.0008838 s

## Power

P = Energy / Time  
P = 66.21 J / 0.0008838 s = 74915 W ~ 75 kW

## Amount of substance

S = M * molar mass of hydrogen  
S = 1.161 g / 1.0079 g/mol  
S = 1.152 mol
