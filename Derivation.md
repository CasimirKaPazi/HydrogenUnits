# Deriving

## Cube of hydrogen gas at it's triple point

Pressure at triple point
Density = (0,08988 kg 1/m³ x 273 K x 7,041 kPa) / (101,325 kPa x 13,8033 K) = 0.1235 kg 1/m³

Mass = Volume x Density
0.211061140542^3 * 0.1235 = 0.001161 kg = 1.161 g

## Pressure on square surface

F = P x A
F = 7041 Pa x 0.211061140542^2 m² = 313.7 N

## Energy/Work

E = Force x Length
E = 313.7 N x 0.211061140542 m = 66.21 J

## Accelerated mass

Time it takes for a body of mass M to travel distance L when accelerated with energy E.

1 J | 2 kg | 1 m | 1 s
66.21 J | 0.001161 kg | 0.211061140542 m | 0.016224 s
0.016224 s / 2 = 0.008112
