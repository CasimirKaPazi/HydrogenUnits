Hydrogen Units
==============

This is a thought experiment on what system of measurement that is universal and with only little arbitrary decisions made. So that any civilization in the universe could come up with the same values.

It is based on the physical properties of Hydrogen and Hydrogen gas.

* All base units are derived from properties of hydrogen(gas) or similar universal values.
* All units have to be in a "human range". Neither to small or to big to perceive.
* Independent from numeral systems used. No arbitrary factors.

Quantity name	| Symbol | Source 					| Value in SI units
----------------|:------:|--------------------------|---
Length			| LH     | Hydrogen line			| 0.211061140542 m
Temperature		| °H     | Triple point of hydrogen	| 13.8033 K
Pressure		| PH     | Triple point of hydrogen	| 7041 Pa
Mass			| MH     | Derived					| 0.001161 kg = 1.161 g
Force			| FH     | Derived					| 313.7 N

Examples
--------

1 m		= 4.738 LH

0 °C	= 19.789 °H  
37 °C	= 22.470 °H  
100 °C	= 27.034 °H  

20 °H = 2.9 °C  
21 °H = 16.7 °C nice cool  
21.334 °H = 21.334 °C  
22 °H = 30.5 °C nice warm  
23 °H = 44.3 °C  

101.325 kPa = 14.3907 PH
